# 🚀 HOSTINGER DEPLOYMENT - STEP BY STEP

## ❌ Current Issue
You're getting this error because you're trying to build on the server without uploading the source code first.

```
> Couldn't find any `pages` or `app` directory. Please create one under the project root
```

## ✅ Correct Deployment Process

### Step 1: Build Locally FIRST
**Do this on your local machine (Windows):**

```bash
# In your project directory: c:\Users\Berlin\Desktop\sss\
npm run build
```

This creates the `.next` folder with your built application.

### Step 2: Upload Files to Hostinger
Upload these files to `/public_html/` via File Manager or FTP:

#### Required Files:
```
📁 public_html/
├── 📁 .next/                    ← FROM LOCAL BUILD
├── 📁 app/                      ← SOURCE CODE
├── 📁 public/                   ← STATIC FILES
├── 📁 lib/                      ← UTILITIES
├── 📁 components/               ← REACT COMPONENTS
├── 📄 package.json              ← DEPENDENCIES
├── 📄 package-lock.json         ← LOCK FILE
├── 📄 next.config.ts            ← CONFIG
├── 📄 server.js                 ← CUSTOM SERVER
├── 📄 .env.local                ← ENVIRONMENT (rename from .env.production)
└── 📄 .htaccess                 ← APACHE CONFIG
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies on Server
**After uploading, run on Hostinger:**

```bash
npm install --production
```

### Step 4: Configure Node.js App
In Hostinger hPanel:
1. Go to Node.js section
2. Create new app
3. Set startup file: `server.js`
4. Set Node.js version: 18 or higher

## 🔧 What You Need to Do Now

### Option A: Upload Pre-built App (Recommended)
1. **On your local machine:**
   ```bash
   cd c:\Users\Berlin\Desktop\sss\
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload these folders/files to Hostinger `/public_html/`:**
   - `.next/` (built app)
   - `public/` (static files)
   - `package.json`
   - `package-lock.json`
   - `next.config.ts`
   - `server.js`
   - `.env.production` (rename to `.env.local`)
   - `.htaccess`

3. **On Hostinger terminal:**
   ```bash
   npm install --production
   ```

### Option B: Upload Source and Build on Server
1. **Upload ALL source code to `/public_html/`:**
   - `app/` folder
   - `lib/` folder
   - `components/` folder
   - All config files
   - All dependencies

2. **Then on Hostinger:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

## 📋 Quick Checklist

Before running any commands on Hostinger:
- [ ] Upload `.next/` folder (if pre-built)
- [ ] Upload `app/` folder (source code)
- [ ] Upload `public/` folder
- [ ] Upload `package.json`
- [ ] Upload `server.js`
- [ ] Rename `.env.production` to `.env.local`
- [ ] Set file permissions (755 for folders, 644 for files)

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Don't build on server** unless you upload ALL source code first
2. **Pre-building locally** is faster and more reliable
3. **Always upload the complete project structure**
4. **Check file permissions** after upload

## 🔍 Current Status
You have the built `.next` folder locally but haven't uploaded the complete project to Hostinger yet.

**Next Action:** Upload the complete project structure to `/public_html/` first, then configure the Node.js app.
