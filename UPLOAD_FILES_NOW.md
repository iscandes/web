# 📦 EXACT FILES TO UPLOAD - HOSTINGER DEPLOYMENT

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM
You're getting this error on Hostinger:
```
> Couldn't find any `pages` or `app` directory
```

**Why?** Because you haven't uploaded your project files yet!

## ✅ SOLUTION: Upload These Exact Files

### 📁 UPLOAD TO `/public_html/` (Hostinger File Manager)

#### 🔥 CRITICAL FOLDERS (Must Upload):
```
1. 📁 app/                      ← Your Next.js source code
2. 📁 .next/                    ← Your built application ✅
3. 📁 lib/                      ← Database utilities
4. 📁 components/               ← React components  
5. 📁 public/                   ← Static files & uploads
```

#### 📄 CRITICAL FILES (Must Upload):
```
6. 📄 package.json              ← Dependencies list
7. 📄 package-lock.json         ← Dependency versions
8. 📄 next.config.ts            ← Next.js configuration
9. 📄 server.js                 ← Custom server ✅
10. 📄 .htaccess                ← Apache config ✅
11. 📄 .env.production          ← Environment (rename to .env.local)
```

### 🚀 UPLOAD STEPS

#### Step 1: Access Hostinger File Manager
1. Login to hPanel
2. Go to File Manager
3. Navigate to `public_html` folder

#### Step 2: Upload Folders First
**Upload these folders from your local project:**
- Drag `app/` folder → upload to `/public_html/app/`
- Drag `.next/` folder → upload to `/public_html/.next/`
- Drag `lib/` folder → upload to `/public_html/lib/`
- Drag `components/` folder → upload to `/public_html/components/`
- Drag `public/` folder → upload to `/public_html/public/`

#### Step 3: Upload Files
**Upload these files:**
- `package.json` → `/public_html/package.json`
- `package-lock.json` → `/public_html/package-lock.json`
- `next.config.ts` → `/public_html/next.config.ts`
- `server.js` → `/public_html/server.js`
- `.htaccess` → `/public_html/.htaccess`
- `.env.production` → `/public_html/.env.local` (rename!)

#### Step 4: After Upload Complete
**Then run on Hostinger terminal:**
```bash
cd /public_html
npm install --production
```

**DO NOT run `npm run build` - you already have the built `.next` folder!**

### 📋 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

**After upload, your `/public_html/` should look like:**
```
📁 public_html/
├── 📁 app/                     ✅ (fixes the error!)
├── 📁 .next/                   ✅ (your built app)
├── 📁 lib/                     ✅ (database)
├── 📁 components/              ✅ (React components)
├── 📁 public/                  ✅ (static files)
├── 📁 node_modules/            ← (after npm install)
├── 📄 package.json             ✅
├── 📄 package-lock.json        ✅
├── 📄 next.config.ts           ✅
├── 📄 server.js                ✅
├── 📄 .htaccess                ✅
└── 📄 .env.local               ✅
```

### 🎯 WHY THIS FIXES THE ERROR

The error `Couldn't find any 'pages' or 'app' directory` happens because:
- ❌ Hostinger server has no `app/` folder
- ❌ Hostinger server has no project structure
- ❌ You're trying to build without source code

**After uploading the `app/` folder:**
- ✅ Server can find the `app/` directory
- ✅ Next.js recognizes the project structure
- ✅ You can run commands successfully

### 🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Upload `app/` folder first** - this fixes the immediate error
2. **Don't build on server** - use your local `.next` folder
3. **Rename environment file** - `.env.production` → `.env.local`
4. **Install dependencies only** - `npm install --production`

### 📞 NEXT ACTION

**Upload the `app/` folder to Hostinger right now!** This will immediately fix your error.

Then upload the rest of the files and you'll be ready to go! 🚀
