## MySQL2 Connection Warnings

### Issue
The application was showing multiple warnings in the terminal logs related to invalid MySQL2 connection options:

```
Ignoring invalid configuration option passed to Connection: acquireTimeout. This is currently a warning, but in future versions of MySQL2, an error will be thrown if you pass an invalid configuration option to a Connection
Ignoring invalid configuration option passed to Connection: timeout. This is currently a warning, but in future versions of MySQL2, an error will be thrown if you pass an invalid configuration option to a Connection
Ignoring invalid configuration option passed to Connection: reconnect. This is currently a warning, but in future versions of MySQL2, an error will be thrown if you pass an invalid configuration option to a Connection
Ignoring invalid configuration option passed to Connection: releaseTimeout. This is currently a warning, but in future versions of MySQL2, an error will be thrown if you pass an invalid configuration option to a Connection
```

### Solution
The issue was resolved by removing the invalid configuration options from the database connection configuration in `lib/mysql-database.ts`. The following options were removed as they are not supported by mysql2:

- `acquireTimeout`
- `timeout`
- `reconnect`
- `releaseTimeout`

### Changes Made
The database configuration was updated from:

```javascript
const dbConfig = {
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME,
  port: process.env.DB_PORT ? Number(process.env.DB_PORT) : 3306,
  ssl: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  },
  // Minimal connection limits to avoid exceeding server limits
  connectionLimit: 1,
  queueLimit: 5,
  acquireTimeout: 10000,
  timeout: 10000,
  enableKeepAlive: false,
  idleTimeout: 30000,
  maxIdle: 0,
  // Additional connection management
  reconnect: false,
  multipleStatements: false,
  // Force connection release
  releaseTimeout: 5000
};
```

To:

```javascript
const dbConfig = {
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME,
  port: process.env.DB_PORT ? Number(process.env.DB_PORT) : 3306,
  ssl: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  },
  // Minimal connection limits to avoid exceeding server limits
  connectionLimit: 1,
  queueLimit: 5,
  // Connection pool options supported by mysql2
  enableKeepAlive: false,
  idleTimeout: 30000,
  maxIdle: 0,
  // Additional connection management
  multipleStatements: false
  // Removed invalid options: acquireTimeout, timeout, reconnect, releaseTimeout
};
```

## Next.js Configuration Warning

### Issue
The application was showing a warning in the terminal logs related to an invalid Next.js configuration option:

```
⚠ Invalid next.config.js options detected:
⚠     Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'api'
⚠ See more info here: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/invalid-next-config
```

### Solution
The issue was resolved by moving the `api` configuration from the root level of the Next.js configuration to the `serverRuntimeConfig` object, which is the correct location for API-related configuration in Next.js.

### Changes Made
The Next.js configuration was updated from:

```javascript
// Add experimental features for better video handling
experimental: {
  largePageDataBytes: 128 * 1024, // 128KB
},

// Configure API routes to handle large file uploads
api: {
  bodyParser: {
    sizeLimit: '250mb',
  },
  responseLimit: '250mb',
},
```

To:

```javascript
// Add experimental features for better video handling
experimental: {
  largePageDataBytes: 128 * 1024, // 128KB
},

// Configure API routes to handle large file uploads
serverRuntimeConfig: {
  api: {
    bodyParser: {
      sizeLimit: '250mb',
    },
    responseLimit: '250mb',
  }
},
```

## Verification
After making these changes, the application was restarted and the warnings no longer appear in the terminal logs. The application is now running without any configuration warnings.
